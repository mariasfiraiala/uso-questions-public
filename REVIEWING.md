# Reviewing Contributed Questions

As a reviewer, you will make sure that questions are of good quality:

* Difficulty is properly set.
* The topic of the question is appropriate.
* Question tags are appropriate and comprehensive.

You will also need to have a good overview of existing questions in the repository to prevent duplicates.

## Working on Pull Requests

You will review contributions as pull requests.
Contributions will need to follow the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Along with the question contents, please vet the commit messages against the [Git commit guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-guidelines).

Question formatting will be validated automatically through the use of a GitHub actions script.

Add your review as comments and request for changes to the PR until everything is ready to be approved.
Then approve the PR.
Once approved, either you or someone with proper access rights can use `Rebase and merge` to merge the PR commits and integrate the contribution.
